Functionnality
1. view all projects
2. view all todos in each project
3. expand a single todo to see/edit its details
4. delete a todo
5. a function that saves the projects (and todos) to localStorage every time a new project (or todo) is created
6. a function that looks for that data in localStorage when your app is first loaded. 
7. a function that edits existing projects (and todos)

Local storage is in JSON: keep in mind you cannot store functions in JSON, you’ll have to figure out how to add methods back to your object properties once you fetch them.
